Architecture Overview:
Enterprise-grade serverless solution with advanced security mechanisms and compliance features.
Key Components:

Network Security: Full VPC isolation with private subnets, security groups, VPC endpoints (S3, DynamoDB, SSM)
Serverless Computing: Lambda functions in VPC with proper IAM roles and least-privilege access
Data Storage: DynamoDB with encryption-at-rest, point-in-time recovery, TTL
Secret Management: SSM Parameter Store with SecureString encryption
Monitoring & Alerting: SNS notifications, SQS dead letter queues, CloudWatch integration
Infrastructure as Code: Full Terraform implementation

Security Features:

Zero Trust Network: All components in private subnets
Encryption Everywhere: S3 AES-256, DynamoDB server-side encryption
Access Control: Granular IAM policies with condition statements
Compliance: S3 lifecycle policies, access logging, versioning
Error Handling: Dead letter queues, proper error propagation
