# Terraform
terraform project


Project 1: Serverless Security Architecture with AWS
Architecture Overview:
Enterprise-grade serverless solution with advanced security mechanisms and compliance features.
Key Components:

Network Security: Full VPC isolation with private subnets, security groups, VPC endpoints (S3, DynamoDB, SSM)
Serverless Computing: Lambda functions in VPC with proper IAM roles and least-privilege access
Data Storage: DynamoDB with encryption-at-rest, point-in-time recovery, TTL
Secret Management: SSM Parameter Store with SecureString encryption
Monitoring & Alerting: SNS notifications, SQS dead letter queues, CloudWatch integration
Infrastructure as Code: Full Terraform implementation

Security Features:

Zero Trust Network: All components in private subnets
Encryption Everywhere: S3 AES-256, DynamoDB server-side encryption
Access Control: Granular IAM policies with condition statements
Compliance: S3 lifecycle policies, access logging, versioning
Error Handling: Dead letter queues, proper error propagation

Project 2: Secure Static Website with Global CDN
Architecture Overview:
High-performance static website hosting with global content delivery, advanced security controls, and geo-restrictions for EU compliance.
Key Components:

Content Delivery: CloudFront distribution with global edge locations
Origin Security: Origin Access Control (OAC) replacing legacy OAI for enhanced security
Storage: Private S3 bucket with server-side encryption and public access blocking
Performance Optimization: Custom cache policies with TTL optimization
Security Controls: HTTPS enforcement, TLS 1.2+ minimum, geo-restrictions
Error Handling: Custom error responses for SPA routing support

Security Features:

Zero Public Access: S3 bucket completely private, accessible only via CloudFront
HTTPS Enforcement: Automatic redirect to HTTPS with modern TLS protocols
Geographic Restrictions: EU-only access whitelist for GDPR compliance
Encryption at Rest: AES-256 server-side encryption for all stored content
Access Control: Conditional IAM policies with source ARN validation
Content Security: Bucket ownership controls and public access blocking

Performance Features:

Edge Caching: Global CDN with configurable TTL policies
Protocol Support: IPv6 enabled for modern connectivity
Cache Optimization: Separate cache and origin request policies
SPA Support: Custom error handling for single-page applications

Project 3: Real-time Network Security Monitoring & Analytics Platform
Architecture Overview:
Enterprise-grade network monitoring solution with real-time log processing, analytics, and centralized security monitoring using AWS managed services.
Key Components:

Network Infrastructure: Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets and NAT Gateway
Data Collection: VPC Flow Logs capturing all network traffic metadata
Real-time Processing: Kinesis Data Firehose for streaming data ingestion
Search & Analytics: OpenSearch cluster with encryption and VPC isolation
Data Pipeline: CloudWatch Logs → Kinesis Firehose → OpenSearch → S3 backup
Security Monitoring: Centralized logging with error handling and backup strategies

Security Features:

Network Isolation: OpenSearch cluster deployed in private subnets with security groups
Encryption: End-to-end encryption (in-transit and at-rest) for all data
Access Control: Fine-grained IAM policies with least-privilege principles
VPC Security: Flow logs monitoring all network traffic for anomaly detection
TLS Enforcement: Minimum TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS communications
Data Protection: Automated S3 backup for failed delivery events

Analytics & Monitoring:

Real-time Insights: Live network traffic analysis and visualization
Log Retention: Configurable retention policies for compliance requirements
Error Handling: Dead letter queues and CloudWatch error logging
Performance Monitoring: Multi-AZ deployment with zone awareness
Data Archival: Compressed storage in S3 for long-term retention
